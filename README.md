<h2> Hello World! </h2>

I am a computational materials science researcher focused on building data-driven models and automation tools to address fundamental and applied problems in the pursuit of accelerated materials discovery. Presently, I am a doctoral candidate at the MINED Group in GeorgiaTech(advised by Dr. Surya Kalidindi), where I develop autonomous systems for robust materials design and modeling.

Prior to joining GT, I conducted research with the late Dr. Srikumar Banerjee (Padma Shri - 2005; former Chairman, Department of Atomic Energy, Govt. of India) and Dr. Brahmananda Chakraborty (Scientist H @High Pressure and Synchroton Radiation Physics Division) at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Mumbai (India), where we thereotically discovered sustainable materials for efficient solid-state Hydrogen Storage.

I am on the job market (2026) and looking for industrial research positions. Do not hesitate to reach out to me if you think I am a good fit!
