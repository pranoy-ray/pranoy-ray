Iâ€™m a computational materials science researcher focused on building data-driven models and automation tools to address fundamental and applied problems in the pursuit of accelerated materials discovery. My advisor is Dr. Surya Kalidindi and I work as a doctoral researcher at the MINED Group in GeorgiaTech. My work involves developing autonomous systems for materials design and modeling to support materials design and discovery.

I completed my undergraduate Thesis under Dr. Brahmananda Chakraborty at the High Pressure and Synchroton Radiation Physics Division (HP&SRPD) in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, India. My main research focus was on applications of Density Functional Theory to develop novel materials for Solid-State Hydrogen Storage.

When I don't </>, I love to get off the grid and go on treks. I plan to get my pilot's license soon.
